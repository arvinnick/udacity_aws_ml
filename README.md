These are excercises from "AWS Machine Learning Foundations Nanodegree" Program. I hope I can get the scholarship although it is not probable. I think these are better to be saved on GitHub than my own machine.



As a part of the course, I had to convert an HTML file into markdown. Here it is:
<!-- 

Copy this code into a text editor with Markdown preview,
OR, you can use Dillinger (https://dillinger.io).

Rewrite this HTML as Markdown.
Take note of:
- How much less code you are writing.
- How readable Markdown vs. HTML is.

Once you're done, go ahead and submit.
You don't need to paste the code back in here.

# My Fabulous Recipe

<p>This recipe for **cereal and milk** has been passed down my family for months.</p>

## Ingredients


- Cereal (you can find cool cereals [here](www.example.com/coolcereals))
- Milk


## Directions

If I were writing these out as _code_, it might look something like this:

```
if bowl is empty:
    add cereal
if bowl only has cereal in it:
    add milk
```
